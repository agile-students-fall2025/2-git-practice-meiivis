[Oracle soars on AI cloud gains, Ellison closes in on Musk as world's richest](https://www.reuters.com/business/oracle-soars-ai-cloud-gains-ellison-closes-musk-worlds-richest-2025-09-10/) — Reuters

## ✨ Why I Find This Interesting

I found this article fascinating because it highlights how **AI and cloud infrastructure are reshaping the software industry**. Oracle is not just competing with traditional enterprise services but is aggressively moving into AI-driven cloud computing by signing massive multi-billion-dollar contracts with companies like OpenAI. This demonstrates how *compute-as-a-service* has become a key foundation for modern applications, and how software engineering today increasingly depends on large-scale cloud platforms.  

What’s also interesting is the broader perspective — the article connects Oracle’s technological progress with shifts in market valuation, competition among cloud giants (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft), and even global projects like Stargate. It shows how innovation in software and infrastructure is directly tied to **business strategy, capital markets, and industry ecosystems**. For me, it’s a reminder that software engineers should not only focus on code but also understand how technology, scalability, and industry trends intersect to drive the future of engineering practice.

### Comment from Ethan Arnold

It's simultaneously awesome and scary that the field has expanded so much that software engineering depends on these massive cloud platforms.
